                Some hairstylists build their careers behind the quiet rhythm of a salon chair. Michael David Warren built his inside the electric chaos of fashion's biggest stages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than following the traditional path of salon apprenticeship, Michael stepped directly into the fast-moving world of fashion editorials and runway shows, assisting legendary hairstylists including Guido Palau, Jimmy Paul, and Jawara during major Fashion Weeks. Those early years placed him at the center of the creative engine that drives global fashion — where instinct, speed, and imagination are required in equal measure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the way, Michael found mentorship from artists whose work helped shape his creative perspective: celebrated hairstylists Yusef Williams, Vernon François, and Naeemah LaFond. Their guidance helped him refine a point of view rooted not only in technical precision but in cultural awareness and storytelling through hair.
              </p>
              <p>
                That path eventually led Michael to collaborate closely with Rihanna's creative team, working with the global icon for nearly four years before becoming her day-to-day hairstylist. The role placed him inside one of the most influential creative ecosystems in modern pop culture — styling for campaigns, editorials, performances, and red-carpet moments seen around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past decade, Michael's work has moved fluidly between fashion, entertainment, and editorial storytelling. His hairstyling has appeared in major publications including Vogue, Vanity Fair, W Magazine, Teen Vogue, Refinery29, Glamour, and Who What Wear, as well as global campaigns including Nike's "Greatest Dynasty Ever."
              </p>
              <p>
                His career has taken him across creative capitals from London and Paris to Tokyo, Stockholm, and Mexico City — building a body of work shaped by international collaboration and a deep appreciation for the cultural language of beauty.

            {/* The Turning Point */}
            <div className="mt-12 p-8 bg-card/50 border-l-2 border-l-accent border border-border">
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-sans leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                Yet the moment that reshaped Michael's understanding of his craft didn't happen on a runway or inside a studio. It happened quietly in a client's kitchen during lockdown.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-sans leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                A client called him in tears. Depression had taken hold, and her hair had become matted beyond what she could face alone. Michael sat with her for hours, gently working through every knot while she cried. When he finished, she looked at herself in the mirror and whispered five words he would never forget:
              </p>
              <p className="font-display italic text-2xl text-foreground/90 my-6">
                "I forgot she was still in there."
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-sans leading-relaxed text-base">
                In that moment, Michael realized something every great hairstylist eventually learns: hair is never just hair. It holds memory. Identity. Confidence. Sometimes even survival.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-muted-foreground font-sans leading-relaxed text-lg">
              <p>
                Michael continues to explore the deeper relationship between beauty and identity — how something as simple as a haircut, a texture, or a style can help someone reconnect with who they are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today he works globally across fashion editorials, campaigns, and creative collaborations while developing new ventures in beauty innovation and education.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/80 font-display italic text-xl border-t border-border pt-8 mt-8">
                When a stylist helps someone see themselves again, the work becomes something far greater than beauty. It becomes restoration.
